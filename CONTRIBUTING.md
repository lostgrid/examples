## Thanks for taking the time to help making LostGrid more accessible!

These little starter projects are to help developers new and veteran get started using LostGrid, PostCSS, or possibly even these built tools.

## Here's what I'd like to ask for contributors

### Keep it simple.
Try to include only the needed tools for your starter project.

### Consistency is key!
For starters, I'm not concerned that there is style consistency across starter projects within this one repo. Every developer has their own style and I won't try to enforce one style here. Do try to **stay consistent with your style in your starter project** though.

### Be nice
Don't make subjective comments about how a build tool might be superior to others unless you can quantify it. I've yet to see a tool that isn't better than others in one case and the opposite is true in another case. Gulp is cool for some. Grunt is cool for others. Some even like their Broccoli. They're all great!

## Thanks!
LostGrid would be nothing without the community around it. Thanks for all the help!
